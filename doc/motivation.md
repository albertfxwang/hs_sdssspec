# Is there a bottom-heavy IMF in the center of massive ETGs  

## Initial Mass Function  

As one of the most important concept in astrophysics, the initial mass function 
(IMF) bridges the detailed processes of star-formation and the evolution of 
stellar populations among galaxies.  It is at the heart of the reliable 
observational interpretations for both resolved and integrated properties of 
galaxies.  From mass-light ratio of the stellar content to the mass of the 
central supermassive black hole, almost every thing the astronomers want to know 
about the history of certain galaxy can be directly or indirectly affected by 
the choice of IMF. 

However, even in our neighborhood, the precise measurements of the IMF is still 
a very difficult job.  Different sources of uncertainties like (XXX 1..2..3..) 
hinder us from getting the definitive picture regarding the actual function form 
of IMF.  Nevertheless, several different empirical forms of IMF have been 
proposed to explain the observations, and until now, most astronomers have 
reached the verdict that the IMF is quite universal among our own galaxy, and 
even in the nearby Small/Large Magellanic Cloud systems.  

Meanwhile, a very fundamental question remains open: Is the IMF really UNIVERSAL 
among all galaxies and across the entire cosmic history?  And, if not, which 
process(es) during the star formation decide such difference?  On what level 
this difference affects our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. 
While the theoretical studies regarding the formation of IMF still can not 
provide a clear answer, many observation evidence have been delivered from 
galaxies near and far: 

1. The stellar population nearby the central SMBH of our Galaxy --> Top Heavy
2. The Carbon-enhanced Extreme-Metal-Poor stars in the halo of Milky Way --> Top 
   Heavy at z>2 
3. The galaxies with very high star-formation rate (e.g. ULIRGs and galaxies at 
   high-redshift) --> Top Heavy
4. The stellar population of Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxies --> Depends on the    
   galactic environment? (Geha+2013)
5. The central stellar population of massive early-type galaxies --> Bottom 
   Heavy 


## IMF of Massive Early-Type Galaxies

Suggested by different lines of observational evidence, a surprising but also 
very intriguing result about the possible bottom-heavy IMF for the central 
stellar population of massive nearby early-type galaxies have gradually emerged. 
Moreover, the slope of the IMF for ETGs was shown to depend on certain 
fundamental properties of the galaxy, such as the central stellar velocity 
dispersion. XXX
